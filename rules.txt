C++ Features:

These rules should be followed to keep programming style simple and C-like, while utilising useful features in C++.

Only use these C++ features:

1. Namespaces
2. Templates
3. References

Only for array structs:

4. Methods
5. Constructor/Deconstructor

An array struct is a struct that manages a memory block. 


Functions:

1. All functions should have an integer return type, where returing 0 is an error and returning 1 is a success. If the function cannot fail it should return void or return a useful value.
2. All value parameters should be const.
3. A parameter should not be a pointer, use a reference, except for memory allocation.
